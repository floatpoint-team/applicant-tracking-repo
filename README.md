### What is this?

This repository serves as a simple __Applicant Tracking System__ for small to medium companies.

The files contain comprehensive __guides__ and __checklists__ that will help you develop a mature hiring process that's right for your company.

You can fork this GitHub repository and use Issues and Projects to organize your hiring pipeline.

### What is an Applicant Tracking System?

An __Applicant Tracking System__ (ATS) organizes the _state_ of each applicant in your hiring pipeline and the _transitions_ between different states.

Common examples of ATS's that you might have heard of are [Greenhouse.io](https://www.greenhouse.io/), [Lever.co](https://www.lever.co/), and [SAP Recruiting](https://www.sap.com/products/recruiting-software.html).

### Why would I use this "Applicant Tracking Repo"?

Each company grows differently.
There is no cookie-cutter method for evaluating who you will end up working with on a daily basis.

Like any important project, iteration and incremental changes are necessary for success.

This "Applicant Tracking Repo" provides guides, checklists, and a basic set of features (well, GitHub's features actually) for hiring.
Hopefully, this will be useful as you slowly develop a more mature hiring process for your company.

## How to Use GitHub for Applicant Tracking

If you're familiar with GitHub issues and projects, then these existing workflows are actually quite nice for tracking applicants:

| Hiring Concept | GitHub Equivalent |
|-|-|
| Job Opening to Hire For | New Project |
| New Applicant | Open New Issue |
| Add Applicant to Job Opening | Add Issue Card to Project |
| Stages in a Pipeline | Project Columns |
| Discussions about an Applicant | Issue Threads |
| Interviewer | Issue Assignee |
| Filterable Details about Applicants | Issue Labels |

> __[Note]__
>
> These concepts are not exact 1:1 mappings.
> After all, GitHub isn't really meant for this use case.
>
> Nonetheless, these analogies can be useful as you design a hiring process that works for you.
