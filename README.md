# Application Tracking Repo

> Organize and review job applicants so no one falls through the cracks.

### What is this?

This repository serves as a simple Applicant Tracking System for small to medium organizations.

You can fork this GitHub repository and use Issues and Projects to organize your hiring pipeline.

### What is an Applicant Tracking System?

An __Applicant Tracking System__ (ATS) organizes the _state_ of each applicant in your hiring pipeline and the _transitions_ between different states.

Common examples of ATS's that you might have heard of are [Greenhouse.io](https://www.greenhouse.io/), [Lever.co](https://www.lever.co/), and [SAP Recruiting](https://www.sap.com/products/recruiting-software.html).

### Why would I use this "Applicant Tracking Repo"?

Hiring is literally the process of choosing who you are going to work with.
Threads of discussion about applicants will guide your decision making process.

If you're familiar with GitHub issues and projects, the existing workflows are actually quite nice as an ATS:

| Hiring Concept | GitHub Equivalent |
|-|-|
| Job or Role to Hire For | New Project
| Stages in a Pipeline | Project Columns
| New Applicant | Open an Issue, and Add Card to Project
| Discussions about an Applicant | Issue Threads
| Interviewer | Issue Assignee
| Filterable Details about Applicants | Issue Labels
